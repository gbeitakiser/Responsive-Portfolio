          Hey there! My name is Gabriel and I'm an odd creature to say the least. I was born in Oakland, California but moved to San Jose, 
          Costa Rica when I was three. After attending kindergarten there, I moved to Tucson, Arizona when I was 5 and stayed there through college. 
          I studied sustainable architecture and city planning at the University of Arizona and graduated with a B.S. in 
          Sustainable Built Environments.  
        </p>

        <br>

        <p id="p2">
          After graduating and interning with Tucson's Office of Integrated Planning, I realized that I love to write and grew impatient with the bureaucracy 
          of city government. I took a 180-degree turn and found a job as an automobile journalist in San Francisco, where I currently reside. 
          I test cars and write about them for a living, but I have an unquenchable thirst for learning
          and an outright obsession with technology and the many ways it shapes our world. That thirst led me to attend this coding bootcamp
          where I aim to learn how to interact with computers on a deeper level.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p id="p3">
            Let me be clear, my focus isnâ€™t just technology but on how to change the underlying systems that govern our society and dictate 
            the direction of our species. I see a great need to adapt and evolve these systems to help us confront the problems we face as a society. 
            Technology is an ally and a powerful tool that can help us solve problems like climate change and wealth inequality. 
            I want to learn the language of computers so that I can advance these causes.
